# exit-ticket

### My perceived earned letter grade: C+/B- 

Oh boy.. 

Let me start by admitting to one thing here (which may be obvious to you: I know i haven't been punctual in my work or thorough. 
However, let me lighten up my wrongdoings with some positive takeaways. This exit ticket will focus on the negatives and the positives it has brought as a result. 

### Preface 

Choosing this course for me was actually fairly simple. I saw "digital" and figured because I love technology and am quite comfortable with fiddling around on a computer, then I would have some engaged interest in this course. The "history" part intrigued me more in the sense that it made me question what digital had to do with history. So I hit register to find out exactly what "digital history" was. Because I honestly thought it was the history of digital devices and systems (easy peasy). 

Of course, I was very wrong and what follows is my journey scouring the archives of the dust web *blows the dust off his laptop*.

### Part 1 - Baby Steps

The beggining of the course went by rather well. Of course this was just to ease into the work. It was easy to follow along and keep up, especially with having free time on my hands as I worked at my job part-time during the lockdown of our practice. While I had the full intentions of maintaning a good work ethic, sometimes, things don<t always fall into place the way you would like them. 

Early on, I did reach out and stated that I needed some advice on a course I was taking alongside this one. I argued that the course was too time consuming and did not benefit me, especially since I had other priorities to weigh in comparison. Dr. Graham did lead me to a sound conclusion and I kept following the course. 

### Part 2 - A Rocky Journey

In the middle of the course, I started to hit a few bumps. Work was picking up and the weight of the stress I was feeling started to weigh me down. I noticed my work ethic sharply decline and I was finding myself unable to complete all the tasks. While I know that is not the point of the course, it also shows thorough work through the week content, to which I have not shown much of in some weeks either. Despite knowing I was slipping, I did not reach out for help as I thought I can just redeem myself. However, just like a snowball runs down a hill, everything just piled up here and there and the loose ends I never tied up came back to haunt me. 

Alas, I continued to follow the course to the best of my abilities. In the light of all these bumps, I was able to apply a lot of the knowledge into my work strangely enough. What I learned in Week 3 and 4 has taught me a lot about the significance of tools in the organization and visualization of information. As I had previously explained, the screwdriver is a tool used for many applications. 

With the impacts of COVID-19 hitting many sectors, I found the tools used in digital history to have a lot of significance in the healthcare section. And while I cannot show examples of the work I have done (as they are medical records that must be stored in the clinic only in a safe server), I can say that I was able to organize many excel spreadsheets and use REGEX expressions to automate information updates and update my patient lists. It was very humbling to understand how the concept of word occurence can play a big part in how we collect information from different parts of time and correlate them. 

### Part 3 - The Fallout 

Nearing the end of the course, I had really dug myself into a hole I cannot climb out of. The work I was submitting was long overdue and I did not put in the vigor I did in many tasks that I would have traditionally done. This required intervention by Dr. Graham and resulted in a very compassionate resolution where I would be able to submit what I had done and move on. While the objective of this course was never to complete everything, I still felt I cannot move on until I had completed atleast most of it. 

In week 5, I found that wasn't the case. The one task of poster design had me thoroughly note down my process and reasoning while providing just as much insight. That task alone generated as much as a whole week for example. That is in part because of the passion I shared with that particular design challenge and wanted to show what I was more engaged in doing. Not to say the previous content wasn't engaging, but this is my livelihood at this point haha. 

### Conclusion 

My work in this course did not live up to my own expectations if i'm to be honest. When I did the work, it was mediocre to good at most and I did not feel I pushed myself hard enough. However, I believe I have walked away this course learning some very valuable tools and insight. This ability of mine to now relate this material into practical application in the real world lead me to believe that I have atleast learned something by putting myself to the test. 

This is why I believe I have earned the aforementioned letter grade of C+/B-. 

You are of course, free to disagree with me (in prefferably the positive way you mentioned on your podcast).
